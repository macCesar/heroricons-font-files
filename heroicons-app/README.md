# Example App with Heroicons

This is an example app created to showcase the seamless integration of Heroicons into a mobile application developed with Titanium SDK. Heroicons, designed by Tailwind Labs, are known for their beautiful and simple design, making them an excellent addition to your mobile app.

## Overview

The example app features a TabGroup with multiple tabs, with the primary focus on the "Icons Tab." In this tab, we demonstrate how to use Heroicons in your mobile app. Here's what you'll find:

- Showcases the usage of Heroicons in both outline and solid styles.
- Displays a variety of Heroicons, demonstrating their versatility and adaptability for your app's user interface.
- The `TabGroup` showcases the potential use of TiKit UI's `Tab` Component and Icon Fonts for a cross-platform app, eliminating the need to create separate images with different resolutions, colors, and densities.
